boon-it.csv
	%_OF_THE_MOON_KING, can be translate into:
		Re Lunare - Lunar King, it's more poetic.  -> I think this one fits best
		Re della Luna - King of the Moon, it claims possession of the moon and possibly more alike the Deutsch version
	BOON_HIDE_OF_KING_GRUVAK, can be translated into:
		Pelle di Re Gruvak - Skin of King Gruvak, perhaps more alike the Deutsch translation.  -> I think this one fits best
		Cuoio di Re Gruvak - Leather of King Gruvak, has more of a worked on meaning.
		Pelliccia di Re Gruvak - Hide(Fur) of King Gruvak, if Gruvak is an animal, hide becomes tighted to the concept of fur, therefore mantle/coat.
	BOON_VAULT_OF_LAZURITH, can be translated into:
		Tesoro di Lazurith - Treasure of Lazurith, more alike the Deutsch translation. -> I think this one fits best
		Ricchezze di Lazurith - Riches of Lazurith, if Vault puts emphasis on its content.
		Volta di Lazurith - Vault of Lazurith, if Vault is more of a storage boon than treasure.
ui-it.csv
	UI_SETTINGS_CONTROLS_CONTROLLER_DEADZONE
		Zona-morta - not sure if it should be translate, just like 'UI' -> Yeah, I think controller deadzone is a gamer term that is known
	UI_SETTINGS_CONTROLS_KEYBOARD_SCREENSHOT
		Can be translated to -> Capture Screen, but don't think it's that neccessary -> Same, screenshot should be self-explanatory without translation
	UI_SETTINGS_SHIP_PERSONAL_STASH
		Usa Collezione Personale -> if stash means collection, can be translated to "Scorta", which means more like "Extra stuff" or "Reserve" -> "Stash" is kind of like a treasure chest to put stuff into (In German I went with "PersÃ¶nliche Truhe verwenden")
	UI_DELETE_BUTTON
		can be both "Elimina"(Erase), "Cancella"(Cancel) - depends on its context -> This is for deleting characters, so "Elimina" is the most fitting I think
	UI_CANCEL_BUTTON
		Cancel can be translate into "Annulla"(cancel action), or "Torna Indietro"(Go back) - depends on its context -> I think "Annulla" is the most fitting here
	UI_DELETE_GAME_HEADLINE
		is this ingame? Or where -> Yes, this is in ship selection, when the player decides to delete a ship (must confirm before doing it)
	UI_SHIP_DESCRIPTION_LEVIATHAN
		Tanky Brute -> can be reduced to "Bruto", Tanky doesn't have a 1:1 translation unless it means "Armoured" -> Yeah, I think armoured would work here!
