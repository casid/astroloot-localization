MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_RESCUE_1,"Oh, thank the stars! I've been stranded here for days.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_RESCUE_2,"Those Haunters have me on the hook. I don't dare to move.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_RESCUE_3,"Help me out, and you'll get first pick once my shop's back online.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GIANT_EGG_START_1,"Things are getting strange this deep into the sector...","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GIANT_EGG_START_2,"I can feel it - my stolen eggs must be nearby.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GIANT_EGG_START_3,"With your help, I know we will find every last one.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GIANT_EGG_START_4,"Oh, and rumor has it... there's a giant egg somewhere out here. A very giant egg.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_1,"Pssst! You! Yes, you!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_2,"You're not gonna believe what I just sniffed out!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_3,"Only the most legendary, most dazzling, most pink treasure in the entire sector!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_4,"The Pink Diamond!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_5,"It's real, and it's being hoarded by the last of Nihalor's creepy old Guardians.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_6,"You shoot the bad things, I grab the treasure. Just like old times!","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GOLDEN_EGG_START_1,"No one has ever ventured this deep into the sector.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GOLDEN_EGG_START_2,"The path to the right leads to Drak'Veth.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GOLDEN_EGG_START_3,"A thief, who stole something of great worth from me long ago.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GOLDEN_EGG_START_4,"Alone, I stand no chance against him. Will you help me get it back?","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_LOST_OPAL_START_1,"Straight ahead lies the lair of King Gruvak.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_LOST_OPAL_START_2,"I'm not sure you're ready for that kind of challenge just yet.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_LOST_OPAL_START_3,"The path to the left leads to the Lost Opal, which I desperately need to have.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_LOST_OPAL_START_4,"Join me, if you want to loot with me on a side quest once more!","Dialog"
MISSION_KING_GRUVAK_DIALOG_1,"Well. Look at you.","Dialog"
MISSION_KING_GRUVAK_DIALOG_2,"You think you're special because you scrapped that deranged mutt and his flea-bitten pup?","Dialog"
MISSION_KING_GRUVAK_DIALOG_3,"My throne is forged from the cores of a thousand fallen ships like yours.","Dialog"
MISSION_KING_GRUVAK_DIALOG_4,"Come, and on behalf of Nihalor, I will end you.","Dialog"
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_1,"So... the final challenger arrives.","Dialog"
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_2,"The stars whispered you would come.","Dialog"
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_3,"I was the last to swear the oath. Not for glory...","Dialog"
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_4,"...but to keep Nihalor sleeping.","Dialog"
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_5,"Strike true, if you must. But know this:","Dialog"
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_6,"When I fall... Nihalor awakens.","Dialog"
MISSION_VETH_MARA_DIALOG_1,"You crushed my spawnlings - shattered their promise before they could feed.","Dialog"
MISSION_VETH_MARA_DIALOG_2,"But I remember you. The slow one. The meddler cloaked in kindness.","Dialog"
MISSION_VETH_MARA_DIALOG_3,"Carlo... you should never have come back to the nest.","Dialog"
MISSION_VETH_MARA_DIALOG_4,"I am the first womb. The ancient rot. The mother of mouths.","Dialog"
MISSION_VETH_MARA_DIALOG_5,"And you... you soft, warm things. You will slide down my throats gladly.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_1,"Light! A friendly face! Wait... you! Oh no.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_2,"That wasn't me. That was Koko - my evil twin sister!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_3,"You didn't notice? The eye-patch? The mad eye underneath it?","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_4,"I mean, come on! I'd never wear something so hideously out of fashion.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_5,"At first she wanted the Pink Diamond. Of course she did. But then...","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_6,"She saw your crafting manual. And that changed everything.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_7,"She said, and I quote - 'Why waste time on one shiny rock when I can make anything I want?'","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_8,"So she ditched me in that pod, grabbed your manual, and ran.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_9,"She'll try to use it for shiny and stupid and probably explode half a planet doing it.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_10,"We have to stop her. Before she turns your manual into a glitter cannon of doom.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_WARM_UP_DIALOG_1,"How about a tiny warm-up?","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_WARM_UP_DIALOG_2,"This part of the sector? Buried in ancient treasures.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_WARM_UP_DIALOG_3,"Could be junk. Could be shiny. Could be cursed. Isn't that exciting!?","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOOT_BOX_DIALOG_1,"Guess what I found! Another one of those shiny, locked-up Loot Boxes!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOOT_BOX_DIALOG_2,"No credits needed. No microtransactions. No 'limited-time offer' popups!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOOT_BOX_DIALOG_3,"This is the real loot. Only way to get one is to come treasure-hunting with me!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOOT_BOX_DIALOG_4,"Ready? Let's goooo!","Dialog"
MISSION_NIHALOR_CHAMBER_DIALOG_1,"Four stood watch in silence. Four bore the weight of eternal vigil.","Dialog"
MISSION_NIHALOR_CHAMBER_DIALOG_2,"Moony... Gruvak... Veth-mara... Lazurith...","Dialog"
MISSION_NIHALOR_CHAMBER_DIALOG_3,"Their strength must flow through you. Only then shall Nihalor's seal break.","Dialog"
MISSION_NIHALOR_CHAMBER_DIALOG_4,"Descend, bearer of all boons - or be unmade.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_START_1,"Well, look what I stumbled upon!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_START_2,"Another set of tombs just begging to be explored!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_START_3,"You can keep all gear we find. Me? I'm just here for the sparkles!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_END_1,"Huh, we found the Tomb of the Fallen Knight!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_END_2,"Rumor has it, the Knight was buried with a pretty powerful weapon.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_END_3,"I'm sure it's dull and dusty by now, so you should take it.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_IRON_VIGIL_DIALOG_1,"Watch out - there are some absolute madlads guarding this place.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_IRON_VIGIL_DIALOG_2,"I'm lucky to have you as my sidekick for this mission. Ready?","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_1_1,"Hmm... this place feels kinda weird... Like, extra weird.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_1_2,"Don't stay in the corrupted area too long, okay?","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_2_1,"Uh-oh... it looks like the treasure moved even deeper into the corrupted area!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_2_2,"Be super duper careful!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_3_1,"Looks like the shiny stuff is hiding way inside the bad zone now.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_3_2,"Why do my treasures always have to be that hard to get?","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_4_1,"Whoa… the Lost Opal. So shiny. So dangerous. So totally worth it!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_4_2,"Let's grab it before the corruption does!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TREASURE_HUNT_START_DIALOG_1,"Hey, you look like someone who can handle a challenge!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TREASURE_HUNT_START_DIALOG_2,"I've found an ancient treasure hidden in this asteroid tomb.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TREASURE_HUNT_START_DIALOG_3,"But it's cursed and guarded by some... let's just say, not-so-friendly creatures.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TREASURE_HUNT_START_DIALOG_4,"I could use a partner in this raid.\nAre you in?","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_1_1,"Looks like those architects thought they could outsmart us with fake tombs.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_1_2,"Little do they know, I raid everything anyway, even if it is absolute garbage.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_1_3,"Let's get in there and make sure we don’t miss a thing. Ready?","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_2_1,"Another tomb? These guys really went all out to keep people away.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_2_2,"Let's keep moving! I feel my treasure's gotta be close.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_3_1,"Don't overthink - it is always the last tomb anyways.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_3_2,"Let's just clear all out and snag my treasure!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_1,"Ohhh, I can't wait to loot this place! My shiny treasures!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_2,"Oh, right...","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_3,"You can have the Wheel of Fortune. One should be around here somewhere.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_4,"I already have one in my collection, so I don't absolutely need another one.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_5,"And the Wheel of Fortune will come in handy on your adventure!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_6,"Ready? Let's goooo!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_5_1,"Ugh, there's a lot of radioactivity coming from this Tomb.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_5_2,"Damn, I really hope the treasure is not in here.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_5_3,"I don't want to decontaminate my loot for the next hundred years.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_5_4,"Be extra careful here, alright? Let's crack this Tomb open!","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_VOLTRON_DIALOG_1,"Alright, we're here for the Voltron Key.","Dialog"
MISSION_KIKI_VOLTRON_DIALOG_2,"Grab it, and we're one step closer to the final treasure. Let's move!","Dialog"
MISSION_KOKO_FIGHT_DIALOG_1,"Oh, don't give me that look. I borrowed the manual.","Dialog"
MISSION_KOKO_FIGHT_DIALOG_2,"You weren't using it properly. So limited... so predictable.","Dialog"
MISSION_KOKO_FIGHT_DIALOG_3,"Kiki never had the vision. But me? I'm gonna rewrite the laws of loot.","Dialog"
MISSION_KOKO_FIGHT_DIALOG_4,"And you? You're just here to lose one last time.","Dialog"
MISSION_KOKO_FIGHT_DIALOG_5,"If you want your manual back...\nCome take it.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_BIG_EGG_DIALOG_1,"Oh wow... this must be it. The big one. The egg from the rumors.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_BIG_EGG_DIALOG_2,"But... this doesn't feel right.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_BIG_EGG_DIALOG_3,"It's not one of mine. This shell... it's twisted. Corrupted.","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_BIG_EGG_DIALOG_4,"Oh dear! Another Egg-Bane! And it's about to hatch!","Dialog"
MISSION_CARLO_BIG_EGG_DIALOG_5,"We have to destroy it - and its broodmother. This ends now!","Dialog"
MISSION_WULFRIC_PHASE_1_1,"Who dares entering my kingdom?","Dialog"
MISSION_WULFRIC_PHASE_1_2,"Oh, what big eyes I have, you ask?","Dialog"
MISSION_WULFRIC_PHASE_1_3,"All the better to see just how outmatched you are. You will die like all the others.","Dialog"
MISSION_WULFRIC_PHASE_2_1,"What big ears I have, eh?","Dialog"
MISSION_WULFRIC_PHASE_2_2,"All the better to hear your last breath.","Dialog"
MISSION_WULFRIC_PHASE_3_1,"What big teeth I have, you ask?","Dialog"
MISSION_WULFRIC_PHASE_3_2,"Stories change, but teeth stay sharp. Care to find out just how sharp?","Dialog"
MISSION_WULFRIC_PHASE_4_1,"I am the Moon King, keeper of the night and guardian of the celestial order.","Dialog"
MISSION_WULFRIC_PHASE_4_2,"So... the one who took my son's life dares to stand before me.","Dialog"
