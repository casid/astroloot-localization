Glossary

The glossary is probably the most tricky part.

There are certain terms in the game that need to be explained to new players.

Those search terms are the IDs in this module without _DESCRIPTION suffix. Search terms can contain pipes |, for instance "burn|burns". This means the system will search for any of those terms in skill or item attributes. If a term is found, the match will be underlined and a description will be shown to the player, when hovering over the term. These descriptions are the "_DESCRIPTION" IDs in this module.

See SKILL_INFO_GLOSSARY and ITEM_INFO_GLOSSARY for examples.
