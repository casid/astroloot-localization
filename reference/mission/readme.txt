Mission

This module contains all mission related texts.

A mission info usually looks like this (see screenshot MISSION_INFO):
- Mission name
- Mission objective
- Monster level
- Action Hints (located in UI module)

For missions that are already completed the name is shown as "Memory - {Mission Name}"

The mission info is also displayed in-game in the top-right corner (see screenshot MISSION_INFO_IN_GAME).

During missions, players get to interact with NPCs from time to time. This is a sequence of short texts the player can step through (see screenshot MISSION_DIALOG).
