MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_RESCUE_1,"ああ、助かった！もう何日もここで立往生していたんだ。","Dialog","Oh, thank the stars! I've been stranded here for days."
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_RESCUE_2,"あのハウンターたちのせいで身動きが取れない。迂闊に動けなくてね。","Dialog","Those Haunters have me on the hook. I don't dare to move."
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_RESCUE_3,"助けてくれたら、ショップが復旧次第、好きなものを選ばせてやろう。","Dialog","Help me out, and you'll get first pick once my shop's back online."
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GIANT_EGG_START_1,"セクターのこんな深くまで来ると、奇妙なことが起こるもんだ...","Dialog","Things are getting strange this deep into the sector..."
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GIANT_EGG_START_2,"わかるんだ...盗まれた私の卵が近くにあるに違いない。","Dialog","I can feel it - my stolen eggs must be nearby."
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GIANT_EGG_START_3,"君の助けがあれば、きっと全部見つけ出せるはずだ。","Dialog","With your help, I know we will find every last one."
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GIANT_EGG_START_4,"そうだ、噂によれば...この辺りのどこかに巨大な卵があるらしい。とてつもなく巨大な卵がね。","Dialog","Oh, and rumor has it... there's a giant egg somewhere out here. A very giant egg."
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_1,"ねえ！そこの君！そう、君よ！","Dialog","Pssst! You! Yes, you!"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_2,"信じられないようなことを聞き出したの！","Dialog","You're not gonna believe what I just sniffed out!"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_3,"このセクターで一番伝説的で、一番まばゆくて、一番ピンクな財宝...","Dialog","Only the most legendary, most dazzling, most pink treasure in the entire sector!"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_4,"ピンクのダイヤモンドの話よ！","Dialog","The Pink Diamond!"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_5,"本物なの。ニヘイラーの不気味で年老いたガーディアンの最後の生き残りが溜め込んでるらしいわ。","Dialog","It's real, and it's being hoarded by the last of Nihalor's creepy old Guardians."
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_PINK_DIAMOND_START_6,"君が悪者を撃って、私がお宝をいただく。昔みたいにね！","Dialog","You shoot the bad things, I grab the treasure. Just like old times!"
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GOLDEN_EGG_START_1,"これまで、セクターのここまで深部に来た者は誰もいない。","Dialog","No one has ever ventured this deep into the sector."
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GOLDEN_EGG_START_2,"右の道はドラクベスに通じている。","Dialog","The path to the right leads to Drak'Veth."
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GOLDEN_EGG_START_3,"昔、私からとてつもなく価値のあるものを奪った盗人だ。","Dialog","A thief, who stole something of great worth from me long ago."
MISSION_CARLO_DIALOG_GOLDEN_EGG_START_4,"私一人では、彼に太刀打ちできない。取り戻すのを手伝ってくれないか？","Dialog","Alone, I stand no chance against him. Will you help me get it back?"
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_LOST_OPAL_START_1,"まっすぐ進んだ先には、グルヴァック王の巣窟があるわ。","Dialog","Straight ahead lies the lair of King Gruvak."
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_LOST_OPAL_START_2,"君にはまだ手に負えないかもしれないわね。","Dialog","I'm not sure you're ready for that kind of challenge just yet."
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_LOST_OPAL_START_3,"左の道は失われたオパールに通じてるわ。私、あれをどうしても手に入れたいの。","Dialog","The path to the left leads to the Lost Opal, which I desperately need to have."
MISSION_KIKI_DIALOG_LOST_OPAL_START_4,"もう一度、私と一緒にサイドクエストでルートしたいなら、ついてきて！","Dialog","Join me, if you want to loot with me on a side quest once more!"
MISSION_KING_GRUVAK_DIALOG_1,"ほう、たいしたものだ。","Dialog","Well. Look at you."
MISSION_KING_GRUVAK_DIALOG_2,"あの狂犬とそのノミだらけの子犬を片付けたからといって、自分が特別だとでも思っているのか？","Dialog","You think you're special because you scrapped that deranged mutt and his flea-bitten pup?"
MISSION_KING_GRUVAK_DIALOG_3,"我が玉座は、お前のような墜落した船千隻のコアから鍛えられたものだ。","Dialog","My throne is forged from the cores of a thousand fallen ships like yours."
MISSION_KING_GRUVAK_DIALOG_4,"来い。ニヘイラーに代わって、お前を殺してやろう。","Dialog","Come, and on behalf of Nihalor, I will end you."
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_1,"そうか...最後の挑戦者が現れたか。","Dialog","So... the final challenger arrives."
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_2,"お前が来るだろうと、星々から聞いていた。","Dialog","The stars whispered you would come."
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_3,"最後に誓いを立てたのは私だった。栄光のためではない...","Dialog","I was the last to swear the oath. Not for glory..."
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_4,"...ニヘイラーを目覚めさせないためだ。","Dialog","...but to keep Nihalor sleeping."
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_5,"必要とあらば、真の一撃を放て。だが、これだけは覚えておけ。","Dialog","Strike true, if you must. But know this:"
MISSION_LAZURITH_DIALOG_6,"私が倒れる時...ニヘイラーが目覚める。","Dialog","When I fall... Nihalor awakens."
MISSION_VETH_MARA_DIALOG_1,"お前は私の子供たちを捻り潰した...あの子たちが糧を得る前に、その未来を打ち砕いたのだ。","Dialog","You crushed my spawnlings - shattered their promise before they could feed."
MISSION_VETH_MARA_DIALOG_2,"だが、お前のことは覚えている。鈍くて、親切を装ったお節介焼きだ。","Dialog","But I remember you. The slow one. The meddler cloaked in kindness."
MISSION_VETH_MARA_DIALOG_3,"カルロ...巣に戻ってくるべきではなかったな。","Dialog","Carlo... you should never have come back to the nest."
MISSION_VETH_MARA_DIALOG_4,"私こそ最初の胎。古代の腐敗。言葉の母。","Dialog","I am the first womb. The ancient rot. The mother of mouths."
MISSION_VETH_MARA_DIALOG_5,"そしてお前たちは...柔らかく、温かい。喜んで私の喉を滑り落ちるがいい。","Dialog","And you... you soft, warm things. You will slide down my throats gladly."
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_1,"光よ！懐かしい顔！待って...あなた！そんな...","Dialog","Light! A friendly face! Wait... you! Oh no."
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_2,"あれは私じゃないわ。ココよ——私の邪悪な双子の姉！","Dialog","That wasn't me. That was Koko - my evil twin sister!"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_3,"気づかなかったの？眼帯や、その下にある狂った目に？","Dialog","You didn't notice? The eye-patch? The mad eye underneath it?"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_4,"勘弁してよ！あんなにひどく時代遅れなものを私が着るわけないでしょ。","Dialog","I mean, come on! I'd never wear something so hideously out of fashion."
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_5,"最初、あの子はピンクのダイヤモンドを欲しがってたわ。もちろんね。でもその後...","Dialog","At first she wanted the Pink Diamond. Of course she did. But then..."
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_6,"あなたのクラフトマニュアルを見たの。それで全てが変わったわ。","Dialog","She saw your crafting manual. And that changed everything."
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_7,"あの子はこう言った...一字一句そのままよ。「欲しいものを何でも作れるなら、どうしてピカピカの石ころ1つに時間を無駄にしなきゃいけないの？」ってね。","Dialog","She said, and I quote - 'Why waste time on one shiny rock when I can make anything I want?'"
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_8,"だからあの子は私をポッドに置き去りにして、あなたのマニュアルをひったくって逃げたの。","Dialog","So she ditched me in that pod, grabbed your manual, and ran."
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_9,"あの子はそれを使って、キラキラしたくだらないものを作ろうとするでしょうね。そのせいで、きっと惑星の半分を爆発させてしまう。","Dialog","She'll try to use it for shiny and stupid and probably explode half a planet doing it."
MISSION_KIKI_RESCUE_DIALOG_10,"あの子を止めないと。あなたのマニュアルが、キラキラ光るドゥームキャノンに変わってしまう前に。","Dialog","We have to stop her. Before she turns your manual into a glitter cannon of doom."
MISSION_KIKI_WARM_UP_DIALOG_1,"ちょっとしたウォーミングアップはどう？","Dialog","How about a tiny warm-up?"
MISSION_KIKI_WARM_UP_DIALOG_2,"セクターのこの辺りね？古代の財宝で埋め尽くされてるわ。","Dialog","This part of the sector? Buried in ancient treasures."
MISSION_KIKI_WARM_UP_DIALOG_3,"ガラクタかもしれないし、ピカピカかもしれないし、呪われてるかもしれない。ワクワクするでしょ？","Dialog","Could be junk. Could be shiny. Could be cursed. Isn't that exciting!?"
MISSION_KIKI_LOOT_BOX_DIALOG_1,"何を見つけたと思う？またあのピカピカで、施錠されたルートボックスよ！","Dialog","Guess what I found! Another one of those shiny, locked-up Loot Boxes!"
MISSION_KIKI_LOOT_BOX_DIALOG_2,"クレジットも、マイクロトランザクションも不要。「期間限定オファー」のポップアップもなし！","Dialog","No credits needed. No microtransactions. No 'limited-time offer' popups!"
MISSION_KIKI_LOOT_BOX_DIALOG_3,"これこそが本物のルートよ。手に入れる唯一の方法は、私と一緒に財宝探しに来ること！","Dialog","This is the real loot. Only way to get one is to come treasure-hunting with me!"
MISSION_KIKI_LOOT_BOX_DIALOG_4,"準備はいい？行くわよ～！","Dialog","Ready? Let's goooo!"
MISSION_NIHALOR_CHAMBER_DIALOG_1,"四人衆は静かに見張りに立った。四人衆は永遠のヴィジルの重みを背負った。","Dialog","Four stood watch in silence. Four bore the weight of eternal vigil."
MISSION_NIHALOR_CHAMBER_DIALOG_2,"ムーニー...グルヴァック...ベスマラ...ラズリス...","Dialog","Moony... Gruvak... Veth'mara... Lazurith..."
MISSION_NIHALOR_CHAMBER_DIALOG_3,"彼らの力がお前の中に流れ込み、初めてニヘイラーの封印は破られるだろう。","Dialog","Their strength must flow through you. Only then shall Nihalor's seal break."
MISSION_NIHALOR_CHAMBER_DIALOG_4,"降臨せよ、全ての恩恵を受ける者よ。さもなくば、消え去るがいい。","Dialog","Descend, bearer of all boons - or be unmade."
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_START_1,"あら、こんなものを見つけちゃったわ！","Dialog","Well, look what I stumbled upon!"
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_START_2,"新しい一連の墓よ！まさに探検してくれって言ってるみたい！","Dialog","Another set of tombs just begging to be explored!"
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_START_3,"見つけた装備は全部あなたのものよ。私？私はキラキラしたものがあればそれでいいわ！","Dialog","You can keep all gear we find. Me? I'm just here for the sparkles!"
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_END_1,"あら、堕落騎士の墓を発見してしまったわね！","Dialog","Huh, we found the Tomb of the Fallen Knight!"
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_END_2,"噂によると、その騎士はかなり強力な武器と一緒に埋葬されたらしいわ。","Dialog","Rumor has it, the Knight was buried with a pretty powerful weapon."
MISSION_KIKI_GEAR_TREASURE_HUNT_END_3,"今頃はもうくすんでホコリまみれだろうから、あなたにあげるわ。","Dialog","I'm sure it's dull and dusty by now, so you should take it."
MISSION_KIKI_IRON_VIGIL_DIALOG_1,"気をつけて。この場所を守っているのはとんでもない連中よ。","Dialog","Watch out - there are some absolute madlads guarding this place."
MISSION_KIKI_IRON_VIGIL_DIALOG_2,"あなたがこのミッションの相棒で運がよかったわ。準備はいい？","Dialog","I'm lucky to have you as my sidekick for this mission. Ready?"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_1_1,"うーん...この場所、なんだか変な感じね...ものすごく奇妙だわ。","Dialog","Hmm... this place feels kinda weird... Like, extra weird."
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_1_2,"コラプト状態エリアに長居しちゃダメよ、わかった？","Dialog","Don't stay in the corrupted area too long, okay?"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_2_1,"マズいわね...財宝がコラプト状態エリアのもっと奥に移動しちゃったみたいだわ！","Dialog","Uh-oh... it looks like the treasure moved even deeper into the corrupted area!"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_2_2,"くれぐれも慎重にね！","Dialog","Be super duper careful!"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_3_1,"ピカピカのものが、ヤバい領域のずーっと奥に隠れちゃってるみたい。","Dialog","Looks like the shiny stuff is hiding way inside the bad zone now."
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_3_2,"どうして私の財宝は、いつも入手しづらいのかしら？","Dialog","Why do my treasures always have to be that hard to get?"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_4_1,"うわあ...失われたオパール。すっごく輝いていて、すっごく危険。でも、それだけの価値は絶対あるわ！","Dialog","Whoa… the Lost Opal. So shiny. So dangerous. So totally worth it!"
MISSION_KIKI_LOST_OPAL_DIALOG_4_2,"コラプションにやられる前に、手に入れるわよ！","Dialog","Let's grab it before the corruption does!"
MISSION_KIKI_TREASURE_HUNT_START_DIALOG_1,"ねえ、あなた。やりごたえのある挑戦なら任せてって雰囲気ね！","Dialog","Hey, you look like someone who can handle a challenge!"
MISSION_KIKI_TREASURE_HUNT_START_DIALOG_2,"この小惑星の墓に隠された古代の財宝を見つけたの。","Dialog","I've found an ancient treasure hidden in this asteroid tomb."
MISSION_KIKI_TREASURE_HUNT_START_DIALOG_3,"でも墓は呪われていて...何と言うか、「あんまり友好的じゃない生き物たち」に守られてるの。","Dialog","But it's cursed and guarded by some... let's just say, not-so-friendly creatures."
MISSION_KIKI_TREASURE_HUNT_START_DIALOG_4,"このレイドにパートナーが必要なのよ。\nどうかしら？","Dialog","I could use a partner in this raid.\nAre you in?"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_1_1,"どうやら設計士の連中は、偽物の墓で私たちを出し抜けると思ったみたいね。","Dialog","Looks like those architects thought they could outsmart us with fake tombs."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_1_2,"たとえそれがガラクタの山だったとしても、私はレイドしてすべてを奪うってことを、あいつらは知らないみたい。","Dialog","Little do they know, I raid everything anyway, even if it is absolute garbage."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_1_3,"さあ、中に入って一つ残らず手に入れましょう。準備はいい？","Dialog","Let's get in there and make sure we don't miss a thing. Ready?"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_2_1,"また墓？あいつら、本気で人を遠ざけにかかってるわね。","Dialog","Another tomb? These guys really went all out to keep people away."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_2_2,"どんどん進みましょう！お宝はもうすぐそこのはずよ。","Dialog","Let's keep moving! I feel my treasure's gotta be close."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_3_1,"考えすぎないで。どうせいつも最後の墓なんだから。","Dialog","Don't overthink - it is always the last tomb anyways."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_3_2,"全部片付けて、私のお宝をいただくわよ！","Dialog","Let's just clear all out and snag my treasure!"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_1,"ああ、この場所をルートするのが待ちきれない！私のピカピカの財宝！","Dialog","Ohhh, I can't wait to loot this place! My shiny treasures!"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_2,"あ、そうだった...","Dialog","Oh, right..."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_3,"幸運の輪はあなたにあげるわ。この辺りのどこかにあるはずよ。","Dialog","You can have the Wheel of Fortune. One should be around here somewhere."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_4,"私はすでに一つ持ってるから、どうしてももう一つ必要ってわけじゃないの。","Dialog","I already have one in my collection, so I don't absolutely need another one."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_5,"それに、幸運の輪はあなたの冒険で役に立つわ！","Dialog","And the Wheel of Fortune will come in handy on your adventure!"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_4_6,"準備はいい？行くわよ～！","Dialog","Ready? Let's goooo!"
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_5_1,"マズいわね、この墓からはかなりの放射能が漏れてるわ。","Dialog","Ugh, there's a lot of radioactivity coming from this Tomb."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_5_2,"最悪。この中には財宝がないといいけど。","Dialog","Damn, I really hope the treasure is not in here."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_5_3,"私のルートを今後100年も除染し続けるなんてごめんだわ。","Dialog","I don't want to decontaminate my loot for the next hundred years."
MISSION_KIKI_TOMB_OF_VIRA_5_4,"ここでは特に気をつけて、いい？さあ、この墓をこじ開けましょう！","Dialog","Be extra careful here, alright? Let's crack this Tomb open!"
MISSION_KIKI_VOLTRON_DIALOG_1,"よし、ここではヴォルトロンの鍵を見つけるわよ。","Dialog","Alright, we're here for the Voltron Key."
